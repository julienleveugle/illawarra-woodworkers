## Butcher's Block Chopping Boards

These boards have end grain up similar to the old butcher's block style for superior wear resistance and long life.

Our chopping boards have no finish applied, for longer life we recommend that they are oiled before use. This is very easy and full instructions are supplied with each chopping board.

They are approximately 300mm square and 25mm thick, but as these boards are individually handcrafted the dimensions will vary slightly.
